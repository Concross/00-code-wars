##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

I chose to keep really general styles in the base.css, styles that determined general layout structure went into layout.css, and the rest went into modules.css

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

No I didn't, but I may go back this evening and play around.
